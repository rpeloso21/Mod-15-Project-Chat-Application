# Web Chat App

## About:
This is a web app that uses WebSocket for a seamless experience.  The user will be prompted to login to a chat room by inputing their username.  They can then communicate with 
everyone else logged into this chat room.

## How to set up:
- Open a terminal

- Visit github.com/rpeloso21/Mod-15--Project-Chat-Application

- Clone the repository

- cd into the project directory 'Mod 15 Project Chat Applicatoin'.

- compile the code.

##  Using the chat room.
- Once the flask app is running, you can go to your localhost page. This is the log in page.  Once you enter a username and hit submit, you will be brought to the chat room
  page.  Here you can type you messages.
